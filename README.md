# CancerImageDetection
Attempt to detect cancer from publically available CT scans using both traditional statistical learning methods and deep learning. 

## Background
This project is a classification task of the LDRI-IDRI database of lung nodules on CT scans (link [here](https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=1966254)). The database contains slices of the CT scans as well as annotated values of each nodule found in the scans. A nodule is a growth of cells in the body which, if malignant, can be cancer.

## Goal
To using classify each nodule found in the dataset to find instances of cancer among the CT scans.

## Methods
We used two methods to find cancer among the nodules:

1) Multinomial statistical learning models trained on each set of annotations describing a nodule. Annotations consistent of markings of the images made by radiologists describing the nodules structure, shape, texture, and other features helpful for determining presence of cancer.

2) Deep learning methods trained on the images themselves 


## Findings
Project is in progress

Final report will be available 04/15/23
